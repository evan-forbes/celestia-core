# CODEOWNERS: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# Everything goes through the following "global owners" by default.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, these three will be
# requested for review when someone opens a PR.
# Note that the last matching pattern takes precedence, so
# global owners are only requested if there isn't a more specific
# codeowner specified below. For this reason, the global codeowners
# are often repeated in package-level definitions.
